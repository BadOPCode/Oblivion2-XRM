Oblivion/2 XRM 
===============

A text based bulletin board system served over Telnet.  
XRM for (Extreme Remake) is my attempt to recreate and emulate one of the most popular DOS basesd BBS software with its one of a kind interface and configurability.

The system is still in very early development.  
You can follow the **changelog** in the root folder for progress updates.
